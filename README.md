**Day0 of 60DaysOfMachineLearningScientist!**
- **Classification**: Today I learned to implement KNearest Neighbors Algorithm.KNearest Algorithm's basic idea is to predict the label of a data point by looking at the 'k' closest labelled data points  and then taking a majority vote. All the ML models are implemented as Python classes and they implement algorithm for learning and predicting and store the information learned from that data. Training a model on the data is also called "fitting" a model to the data using .fit() method. To predict the labels of new data .predict() method is used.In classification, accuracy is commonly used metric. Accuracy = Fraction of correct predictions. To measure the model performance, we split the data into training and testing set using train_test_split() method and then fit/train the model on the training set and make predictions on test and then compare predictions with the known labels, we use .score() method to do that.Larget valaue of 'k' can lead to less complex model and underfitting and smaller value of 'k' = more complex model and can lead to overfitting. So those are the things that I learned today at Day 0. I am very excited to learn upcoming chapters and share it on the github.
